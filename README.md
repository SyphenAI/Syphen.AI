9 years building and breaking security at a Fortune 500 bank → Now independent

I spent the last three years standing up one of the first real AI security programs in regulated finance — from nothing to full maturity.

Before that I built the red team from scratch, ran purple-team cycles, and turned threat intel into detection that actually worked.

Now I’m, Creating tools I always wished existed and helping teams who can’t afford (or don’t trust) the big vendors.

### What I actually do every day
- Red-team LLMs, RAG pipelines, and agentic systems
- Automated threat modeling against MITRE ATLAS & OWASP AI
- Build scanners and playbooks that catch prompt injection, model poisoning, MCP exploits, supply-chain backdoors
- Turn regulatory frameworks (NIST AI RMF, OCC SR 11-7, FFIEC) into something engineers can action instead of ignore

### Tools I’m shipping TBD
syphen.ai → Open-core AI security + compliance dashboard (coming online soon)  
Self-hosted, no sales calls, priced for small teams and indie builders.
